Browser compatibility
---------------------

Currently, the Web Bundles API only supports Chromium-based browsers with an experimental brand.

Introducing the Web Bundles API
-------------------------------

A Web Bundle is a file format for encapsulating one or more HTTP resources in a single file. It can include one or more HTML files, JavaScript files, images, or style sheets.

Web packages, more formally known as [HTTP exchanges included](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges.html), are part of the [Web Packaging](https://github.com/WICG/webpackage)  
proposal.

How To Install:
------------------------

1.  Visit `chrome://version` to see what version of Chrome you are running. If you are running version 80 or later, skip the next step.
    
2.  to download [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/) if you are not running Chrome 80 or later.
    
3.  Open `chrome://flags/#web-bundles`.
    
4.  Select the **Web packages** flag as **Enabled**.

    Enable web packages in `chrome://flags`  
    
5.  Restart Chrome.
    
6.  Drag and drop the `folktabs.wbn` file in Chrome if it's on desktop, or tap it in a file manager app if it's on Android.
    

Everything works magically.
